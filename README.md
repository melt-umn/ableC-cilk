# edu.umn.cs.melt.exts.ableC.cilk

The Cilk parallel programming constructs implemented as a language
extension to ableC.

# Status

### What works
+ in the `examples` directory, running `compile_fib_xc.sh` will
  compile `fib.xc` in a round-about way.
  It does require that ableC doesn't parse some header files.

  `run_fib.sh` will run the generated `a.out` file.
